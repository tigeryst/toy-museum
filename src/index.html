          Perhaps the largest and first of its kind in Asia, Batcat Museum and
          Toy owns the largest collection of superheroes' (Batman, Superman,
          Spiderman, to name a few) collectibles and toys, ranging from
          mini-figures to life-sized models. Imagine you will be surrounded by
          some 50,000 collectibles of superheroes you were dreaming of when you
          were just a kid. Some of which were created in the 60s and no longer
          on display elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside our large collection of toys, we also hold special
          exhibitions. You may check the current exhibitions by following the
          link above.
